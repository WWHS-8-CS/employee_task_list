For this assignment, we were asked to develop a solution for a workplace problem: task management.
By implementing stacks and queues, I was able to create a program to let an employee add, view and 
remove tasks and allow an employer to se what had been accomplished. I used four classes for this 
project; a queue class for the priority queue, a stack class for completed tasks, an employee class 
to implement the storage related to an employee, a task class for tasks, and a mainframe class for 
the manager and employees to use to view everything. 

In the future, this program could be improved by adding a GUI to simplify use for non-technical members
of the workforce and users who find anything on a console terminal foreign and difficult to use. Also,
in the mainframe class, a list of employees could be added to allow for the monitoring of many members 
of the workforce instead of only Employee Aeron aka 'e'. Lastly, to simplify the construction of the 
software, I could've used the java libraries for queues and stacks, instead of building my own.
